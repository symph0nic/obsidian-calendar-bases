Built with [FullCalendar](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar) for a robust and feature-rich calendar experience.

- Dynamically display entries that match your filters on their respective dates.
- Drag and drop events to reschedule them - automatically updates note frontmatter.
- Navigate between months with intuitive controls.
- Support for single-day and multi-day events (with optional end dates).
- Click entries to open them or use context menus for more options.

### Date Properties

To display entries on the calendar, configure a start date property in the view configuration menu. The property must contain a valid date string.

```yaml
# Date property examples
startDate: 2025-10-15
startDate: 2025-10-15T10:00:00

# Optional end date for multi-day events
endDate: 2025-10-18
```

Any JavaScript-parseable date format is supported. For multi-day events, configure both a start date and an optional end date property.

### Image and property overlay

This fork adds the ability to put images in the daily cells, as defined by a property. It also permits adjusting the size of the day number and the opacity of the pill behind each overlaid property. There's also a slider to adjust the height of the day cells.
